first i created a database called "DBCarpeteroInventory.DB" because it is for carpetero Inventory. 
then i add 7 table in the database it is "ID", "LEFT", "TOP", "BOTTOM", "RIGHT", "TYPE", and "CREATED_AT". 
"ID" a unique,Integer,and as a primary key for my data.
"LEFT" a Text to hold the size or length of left side of the carpet.
"TOP" a Text to hold the size or length of top side of the carpet.
"RIGHT" a Text to hold the size or length of right side of the carpet.
BOTTOM a Text to hold the size or length of bottom side of the carpet.
"TYPE" a text variable to hold the type of carpet.
"CREATED_AT" a text for hold the date when did the carpet received.

(see pictures attachment number 1) = it represent that 3 carpet received in same date the 2 carpet is the same type and same size of 100mx100m.

After received the 3 carpet. carpetero has a buyer for their carpet the buyer want a carpet with a size of 10x10m and a type of wool, so the carpetero cut the 10x10m in one of their wool carpet.

(see picture attachment number 2 and 2.5) = it represent that the 10x10m already cut in one of the wool carpet.

after that carpetero has a buyer again and it want a carpet with a size of 10x90m wool type, so the carpetero cut the 10x90m in one of their wool carpet

(see picture attachment number 3 and 3.5) = it represent that 10x90m already cut in one of the wool carpet.


the first receive of the wool type carpet is the one who use to cut for the order of 10x10m and a 10x90m carpet. we need to consume the first carpet wool type before we use the another carpet wool type for the orders.
